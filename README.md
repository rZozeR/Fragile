This is a project I made for a game development company "Panteon".
It includes the complete Unity file and the game file.
Most 3D assets are provided by them and not made by me.
Other remaining features are all made by me the span of 10 days.

Disclaimer; Project was created with the Unity 2019.4.22f1 version. Couple of bugs still remain mostly caused by the AI or the physics collisions.
